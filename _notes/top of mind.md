These are my unfiltered thoughts. Think of it as a public journal. Most of these are incomplete thoughts, some are questions, but overall...it should give you a glimpse into where my mind is currently focused.

**July 2020**
- The cost of capital and carbon footprint are on a collision course.
- Where do the changing demographics of industrial workers and the consumerization of enterprise meet?
- Being okay with inaction in order to maximize understanding
- Placing the emphasis on risks and not just counting them
