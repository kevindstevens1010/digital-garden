Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: most people write in fleeting notes.

Fleeting notes are valuable scratchpads to temporarily support working memory, but Knowledge work should accrete, so we should view them as “messy-thought” inputs for the “neat-thought” notes they’ll inform.

It’s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help:

[[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]

Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented

Evergreen notes should be densely linked
