My focus is on finding 3-5 underlying concepts and the author's evidence that supports them in order to distill books into practical application via "zettles" or [evergreens](https://www.roambrain.com/andy-matuschak-note-taking-system/).

I won't be editing them much, so at times things may seem out of context.  I'm now using the zettelkasten method for my notetaking, and implementing it in a style similar to [Shu Omi](https://twitter.com/ShuOmi3)'s.
