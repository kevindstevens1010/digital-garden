# Welcome! 🌱

These notes are mostly written for myself. But I share some of them publicly in order to foster conversation around the notes where I still need to clarify my thinking. If a note seems confusing or incomplete, don't adjust your set, it's probably on purpose.

This part of my blog is based on my [interpretation of the Zettlekasten method](/interpretation of the Zettlekasten method) which has been made popular by the book "How to Take Smart Notes".

The most common topics I write about are [[energy]], [[climate]], [[tech]], and [[company building]]. They are all good starting points, but you also might be interested in my [bookshelf](/bookshelf) or [[top of mind]]

You'll notice there is no navigational aids - you need to click a clink on this page to get started. Oh, and if you see [[]], that means a page is coming soon, but I haven't it created yet.
