# Welcome! 🌱

These notes are mostly written for myself. But I share some of them publicly in order to foster conversation around the notes where I still need to clarify my thinking. If a note seems confusing or incomplete, don't adjust your set, it's probably on purpose.

This part of my blog is based on my [interpretation of the Zettlekasten method](/interpretation of the Zettlekasten method) which has been made popular by the book "How to Take Smart Notes".

The most common topics I write about are:

<p style="margin-left: 40px"> - [[energy]]</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">- [[climate]]</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">- [[investing]]</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">- [[tech]]</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">- [[company building]]</p>


You'll notice there is no navigational aids - you need to click a clink on this page to get started. The topics above are good starting points, but you also might be interested in my [bookshelf](/bookshelf) or [[top of mind]]
